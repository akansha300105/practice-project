    <h2>Northeast India: A Tapestry of Culture and Cuisine</h2>
    <p>The Northeast is often called the "Seven Sisters and a Brother", referring to the seven states (Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura) and the newer addition, Sikkim. This region is geographically isolated, connected to the rest of India by a narrow strip of land (the Siliguri Corridor), which helped preserve its distinct identity and traditions.</p>
